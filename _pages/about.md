<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I‚Äôm currently a research scholar in the AIM program housed at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School focusing on generalizable and scalable deep learning to develop biomarkers for precision care in oncology. I‚Äôm also in the 3rd year of my PhD program at the GROW School for Oncology and Reproduction @ Maastricht University advised by Prof. Hugo Aerts.

Amidst the pandemic, I graduated cum laude with a MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences at Maastricht University and worked on AI-assisted radiotherapy at MAASTRO Clinic. I come from an engineering background (Bachelors in Electronics and Comms Engg.) with skills honed through freelancing and roles at several startups.

With my experiences, I hope to build AI and engineering systems that can benefit medical care.

Whenever I get a chance, I enjoy spending time in nature (New England is a birders paradise) and digging deeper into topics in metaphysics, ethics, epistemology and world history.
