<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I‚Äôm currently a research scholar at the Mass General Cancer Center working on building agentic solutions for radiotherapy treatment planning with [Dr. Raymond Mak](https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/111/raymond-mak-radiation_oncology-boston). Radiotherapy treatment planning lies at the convergence of physics, biology and computation making it an interesting and impactful use-case to bring agents to.

I'm in the final year of my PhD (waiting to defend my thesis) at the AIM program housed at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School where I largely focused on developing representation learning methods for cancer imaging and oncology, advised by [Prof. Hugo Aerts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugoaerts/). Amidst the pandemic, I graduated cum laude with a MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences at Maastricht University and worked on AI-assisted radiotherapy at MAASTRO Clinic. I come from an engineering background (Bachelors in Electronics and Comms Engg.) with skills honed through freelancing and roles at several startups.

With my experiences, I hope to build AI and engineering systems that can benefit medical care.

Whenever I get a chance, I enjoy spending time in nature (New England is a birders paradise), meditation and digging deeper into topics in metaphysics, ethics, epistemology and world history.
